# SSSSSONDER WEB_TEACHING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM ðŸ˜‰
## Welcome to Siyu YanYan's first project!!!ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—
The project is the pioneering work of the front-end Three Musketeers technology learning. Based on the A19 competition question of the 14th Service Outsourcing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, a Sonder cloud platform teaching management system was created. Currently, the current project only opens up the front-end interface.The overall front-end technology of the project uses native HTML+CSS+JavaScript, and some components adopt absolute positioning. The 16:9 screen is the most suitable ratio and the interface effect is the best.

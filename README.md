<p>Welcome to Siyu YanYan's first project!!!ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—</p>

The project is the pioneering work of the front-end Three Musketeers technology learning. Based on the A19 competition question of the 14th Service Outsourcing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, a Sonder cloud platform teaching management system was created. Currently, the current project only opens up the front-end interface.The overall front-end technology of the project uses native HTML+CSS+JavaScript, and some components adopt absolute positioning. The 16:9 screen is the most suitable ratio and the interface effect is the best.

## Web interface effect display
- **Login and registration interface**
  
  The login interface of users' name, password, and verification code is implemented separately, the verification code is designed as a replacement for the blue square block, and the registration interface is designed, and the complete function flow line is implemented.
